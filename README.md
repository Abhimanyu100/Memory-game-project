# Descripton of the Game
This a memory game project. In this game, players try to find the eight pair of cards located 
among 16 cards. In this game, the players are instructed to open two cards at a time. If the cards matched than they
will stay open and than they move to match the remaining card. If the cards don't match than they will stay open
for a second so that the user (player) can try to  remember the card and they close back up. In this game the player successfullly win the game when he/she matched all cards. Less the time user (Player) takes to find the pairs best his/her performance is.
